# MailLaser (ai-kkr fork)

Turn incoming emails into webhook calls -- no mail server required.

This is the [ai-kkr](https://github.com/ai-kkr/mail-laser) fork of [Govcraft/mail-laser](https://github.com/Govcraft/mail-laser). It adds catch-all recipient domains via `MAIL_LASER_TARGET_DOMAINS` (any local-part at a listed domain) while remaining compatible with exact `MAIL_LASER_TARGET_EMAILS` matching. Images publish to `ghcr.io/ai-kkr/mail-laser`.

MailLaser is a lightweight SMTP server that receives emails and instantly forwards them as JSON payloads to any HTTP endpoint. Connect email to Slack, Discord, Zapier, or your own API with a single Docker command and two environment variables.

- **Zero complexity** -- No mailbox, no storage, no email parsing libraries in your app. MailLaser handles SMTP and delivers clean JSON.
- **Deploy in minutes** -- One Docker command or a single binary. Configure with two required environment variables and you are running.
- **Authenticated senders** -- Optional SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation rejects spoofed mail at the SMTP layer or annotates the payload with the authentication outcome.
- **Policy-based authorization** -- Cedar policies decide which senders may reach which recipients and which attachments are permitted, all in a declarative policy file.
- **Attachment pass-through** -- Deliver attachments inline as base64 in the JSON payload or upload them to an S3-compatible bucket (AWS, MinIO, R2, Wasabi) and include the URL.
- **Signed webhooks** -- Optional HMAC-SHA256 request signing lets your endpoint verify each payload came from MailLaser and was not modified in transit.
- **Built-in resilience** -- Automatic retries with exponential backoff and a circuit breaker protect your webhook from cascading failures.
- **Lightweight** -- A statically linked Rust binary around 17 MB on a scratch Docker image. No runtime dependencies.

## Quick start

Start MailLaser with Docker. Set either exact target addresses, catch-all domains, or both, plus your webhook URL:

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name mail-laser \
  -p 2525:2525 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e MAIL_LASER_TARGET_DOMAINS="mail.example.com" \
  -e MAIL_LASER_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-api.com/webhook" \
  -e MAIL_LASER_CEDAR_POLICIES="/etc/mail-laser/policies.cedar" \
  -v "$PWD/policies:/etc/mail-laser:ro" \
  ghcr.io/ai-kkr/mail-laser:3
```

Exact addresses still work (`MAIL_LASER_TARGET_EMAILS`). At least one of `MAIL_LASER_TARGET_EMAILS` or `MAIL_LASER_TARGET_DOMAINS` must be non-empty.

Webhook URL: use `https://…` for public endpoints. In the release image, plain `http://…` is allowed for loopback, Docker Compose service names (e.g. `http://app:8000/api/v1/webhooks/mail-laser`), and private/link-local IPs.

Send a test email with [swaks](https://www.jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/):

```shell
swaks \
  --to any-id@mail.example.com \
  --from test@sender.com \
  --server localhost:2525 \
  --header "Subject: Test from swaks" \
  --body "Hello from MailLaser!"
```

Your webhook receives a JSON POST:

```json
{
  "sender": "test@sender.com",
  "recipient": "alerts@example.com",
  "subject": "Test from swaks",
  "body": "Hello from MailLaser!"
}
```

Other installation methods (pre-compiled binaries, Nix, building from source) are covered in the [Installation guide](https://govcraft.github.io/mail-laser/docs/installation).

## How it works

1. **Listen** -- Accept SMTP connections on port 2525 (configurable), with a per-IP connection cap that bounds noisy clients.
2. **Authenticate** -- Optionally run SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks against the sender. Enforce mode rejects spoofed mail with `550 5.7.1`; monitor mode annotates the payload with the outcome for downstream consumers.
3. **Authorize** -- Evaluate a Cedar policy against the sender, the recipient, and each attachment. Denials reject the transaction at end-of-DATA.
4. **Parse** -- Extract sender, recipient, subject, plain text body, optional HTML body, headers, and MIME attachments.
5. **Forward** -- POST the payload as JSON to your webhook, optionally HMAC-signed. Attachments ride inline or upload to S3 first. Automatic retries and a circuit breaker protect the endpoint.

A separate health check server on port 8080 responds to `GET /health` for monitoring integration. See the [Architecture](https://govcraft.github.io/mail-laser/docs/architecture) page for the full actor-based design.

## Development

```shell
cargo build           # Debug build
cargo test --lib      # Unit tests (no Docker needed)
cargo test            # Full suite (integration tests require Docker)
cargo build --release # Optimized release build
```

Integration tests under `tests/` use [testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs) to spin up MockServer and MinIO. A running Docker daemon is required. The first run pulls the MinIO image (~150 MB); allow ~30s extra.

See [Architecture](https://govcraft.github.io/mail-laser/docs/architecture) for the module structure and design decisions.
